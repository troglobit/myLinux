	help
          Take extra care to verify the resulting system behavior when
	  changing these option(s).  They are marked advanced for the
	  very reason that they may brick your system!

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_CUSTOM_FSTAB
	string "Custom /etc/fstab"
	default "/etc/fstab"
	help
	  In certain use-cases, e.g., embedded systems with a secondary
	  partition, or when testing in factory production, users may
	  want to mount system partitions from an fstab file other than
	  /etc/fstab.

	  This setting allows changing the default fstab Finit looks for.
	  It can be set to any file in fstab format, even the emtpy string
	  in case you do not want a default fstab.

	  To select a different fstab at boot time, use the following kernel
	  command  line option.  Remeber the -- separator for kernel options
	  and options destined for PID 1.

	      finit.fstab=/etc/fstab.alt

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_INITCTL_GROUP
	string "Group for /run/finit/socket"
	default "wheel"
	help
	  On systems with multiple administrators, set the group
	  to their shared UNIX group, usually "wheel", to allow
	  them to start/stop services and reboot the system.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_KEVENTD
	bool "finit-keventd"
	default n
	help
	  Build bundled finit-keventd, which monitors kernel events
	  for AC power status and generates sys/pwr/fail condition.
	  This is a new feature in Finit v4.1 and is still very much
	  in an experimental state.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_SULOGIN
	bool "finit-sulogin"
	default n
	help
	  Build bundled finit-sulogin, which handles rescue mode
	  and cases where fsck fails.  Its job is to ask for the
	  password for the root user, and start a login shell so
	  an administrator can perform corrective maintenance.

	  This is disabled by default since most users prefer the
	  distribution specific (Busybox) sulogin instead.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_WATCHDOG
	bool "finit-watchdogd"
	default n
	help
	  Build bundled finit-watchdogd, which provides a simplistic
	  watchdog daemon that runs in the background, kicking the
	  systemd default /dev/watchdog to prevent reboot.  This is
	  useful in very small systems where its grownup old cousin
	  watchdogd cannot be used.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

if BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_WATCHDOG

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_WATCHDOG_DEV

	default "/dev/watchdog"
	help
	  Device node to use for finit-watchdogd.  The default is
	  usually sufficient, but some systems have more than one.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_HOTPLUG
	bool "hotplug plugin (mdev/udev)"
	help
	  By default, Finit builds and launches its hotplug plugin.
	  It is responsible for detecting and starting the mdev tool,
	  or udevd daemon.  The former exists in many BusyBox based
	  systems and is called for "cold plugging".  The latter has
	  many various incarnations and is mostly used for desktop
	  systems.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_HOOK_SCRIPTS
	bool "hook scripts"
	default n
	help
	  Adds a run-parts(8) script runner for Finit hook points.  When
	  enabled, it allows extending and customizing the boot process
	  and do early boot debugging long before regular services are
	  available.

	  For example, say that you want to enable some kernel tracing
	  before modules are loaded.  With hook-scripts, you can just
	  drop in a shell script in /libexec/finit/hook/mount/all/ that
	  will poke the right control files in tracefs.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_MODULES_LOAD
	bool "Scan /etc/modules-load.d"
	help
	  Scans /etc/modules-load.d for modules to load.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_MODPROBE
	bool "Coldplug modules using modalias magic"
	help
	  Coldplug modules using modalias magic.  Everything is
	  handled automatically based on device trees and their
	  matching kernel modules.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_RTC
	bool "RTC plugin"
	help
	  By default, Finit builds and launches its RTC plugin.  It is
	  responsible for restoring the system clock from the RTC clock
	  at boot, and saving the system clock to RTC at reboot.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

if BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_RTC

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_RTC_DATE
	string "Fallback RTC date"
	help
	  On many embedded systems there is no RTC battery, maybe there
	  is a "supercap" but on first boot it is usually out of juice.
	  When this happens the RTC will return its default value, or
	  the driver will fail and report error.  In these cases Linux
	  will detect a too old/invalid date set from userspace.  Any
	  date prior to 2000-01-01 00:00 is denied.  (Previously this
	  was the start of the UNIX epoch, Jan 1 1970.)

	  This setting changes the default fallback date/time the RTC
	  plugin uses in case of such failures.  Useful, e.g., for an
	  HTTPS certificate generated at first boot before any network
	  connection (DHCP/NTP) has been made to get the current time.
	  Ensuring the default system time to be closer to actual time
	  for a period after releasing a firmware image.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_TTY
	bool "TTY plugin"
	help
	  Automatically resart tty services that are plugged in.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_URANDOM
	bool "/dev/urandom plugin"
	help
	  By default, Finit builds and launches its urandom plugin.  It
	  is responsible for seeding /dev/urandom from a previously saved
	  seed at boot, and saving a seed at reboot.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.
